  <div>
    <h3>Normal Email</h3>
    <a href="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</a>
    <p>This is a plain text email with a mailto link. Pretty standard
    but it's easily scrapped by spammers. I made the text black and
    removed the underline with css</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>canMail Canvas Email</h3>
    <span id="norm-email">Email protected with
      javascript. Enable it to continue</span>
    <p>canMail with the email text rendered on canvas. This way the
      email is never in the DOM as plain text. The closest the email
      is to being in plain text is as a javascript variable in a few
      function calls. canMail tries its best to pull relevant font
      styling from the container its in, but it won't pull everything
      yet. In addition, the canvas font measuring leaves much to be
      desired and I don't make claims about how well it works between
      browsers. Also note, that because its rendered on canvas, it
      doesn't scale well as you zoom in on the page.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>canMail Canvas Email with Link</h3>
    <span id="link-email">Email protected with
      javascript. Enable it to continue</span>
    <p>You may want the email to have a mailto link so people can copy
      the email or just click it. canMail only puts the href attribute
      in the link when a mouseover event is handled, and it removes it
      on mouseoff, so as to have the email in the DOM as little as
      possible.</p>

  <div>
    <h3>canMail Canvas Email with WebFont</h3>
    <span id="webfont-email">Email protected with
      javascript. Enable it to continue</span>
    <p>This API can handle rendering webfonts, but one has to make
      sure that the email isn't rendered until the webfont is
      loaded. This can be accomplished with the WebFont loader. See
      the
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader">API</a>.</p>
    <p>Thanks to <a href="http://creativejs.com/2011/12/day-6-webfonts-canvas/">Creative JS</a> for pointing out how to do this</p>
